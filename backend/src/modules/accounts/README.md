# Accounts Module

## Purpose

The Accounts module exposes the HTTP API for a signed-in user to manage their own
connected social accounts: list them, manually create one, update its status, and
soft-disconnect it. It moves this logic off the Next.js `frontend/app/api/accounts`
route (which talked to Supabase with the service-role key and an unverified JWT) and
onto the Express backend, where the JWT is verified and every query is scoped to the
caller.

Real accounts are still connected by the provider OAuth callbacks through the
[Social Connections](../social-connections/README.md) module; this module manages the
resulting records.

## Routes

All routes are mounted at `/api/accounts` and require a valid session
(`authenticate`). They are **user-scoped**, not admin-only — every query is filtered by
`req.user.id`, so a user only ever sees or mutates their own accounts.

| Method & Path             | Purpose                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /api/accounts`       | List the caller's active accounts, newest first, with nested `platforms`. |
| `POST /api/accounts`      | Manually create (mock-connect) an account. Returns `201`.               |
| `PATCH /api/accounts/:id` | Update status/details (`is_active`, `username`, `display_name`).        |
| `DELETE /api/accounts/:id`| Soft-disconnect: sets `is_active = false`. The row and OAuth token are kept. |

`PATCH` and `DELETE` return `404` when no account with that id belongs to the caller.
Request bodies are validated with Zod (`accounts.schema.js`); responses use the shared
`{ success, data }` envelope.

### Request / response shapes

- `POST` body: `{ platformCode, external_id, username?, display_name? }`.
- `PATCH` body: at least one of `{ is_active, username, display_name }`.
- Account object (in `data`): `id, username, display_name, profile_url, avatar_url,
  is_active, connected_at, platforms { id, code, name }`.

## Data Ownership

This module reads and writes the `social_accounts` table (owned schema-wise by
[Social Connections](../social-connections/README.md)). It reuses
`socialConnectionsRepository.getPlatformId(platformCode)` to resolve a platform `code`
to its id on create, rather than importing the Supabase client for that lookup. It does
not touch `oauth_tokens` — a soft disconnect intentionally leaves the token in place so
the account can be reconnected later.

## Module Files

- `accounts.routes.js` — router; applies `authenticate` and `validate(...)`.
- `accounts.controller.js` — thin HTTP layer; maps not-found to `404`, unknown platform to `400`.
- `accounts.service.js` — business logic; resolves platform ids and unwraps repository errors.
- `accounts.repository.js` — `social_accounts` queries (`findActiveByUser`, `insertAccount`, `updateForUser`).
- `accounts.schema.js` — Zod schemas for create / update / id-param.
- `accounts.routes.test.js` — `node --test` + `supertest` coverage.

## Frontend Integration

The Next.js route `frontend/app/api/accounts/route.ts` is now a thin proxy: it forwards
the `auth-token` cookie to the backend as a `Bearer` header and unwraps the envelope so
the accounts and analytics pages keep receiving the same shapes as before (a bare array
from `GET`, a single object from `POST`, `{ success: true }` from `DELETE`).

Set `BACKEND_API_URL` or `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API_URL` for the frontend server if the
backend is not running at `http://localhost:5000/api`.

## Dependencies

- Middleware: `src/shared/middleware/auth.middleware.js`, `validate.middleware.js`
- Utils: `src/shared/utils/response.util.js`
- Infrastructure: `src/infrastructure/database/supabaseClient.js`
- Environment variables: `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_KEY`, `JWT_SECRET`

## Known Limits

Account "status" is the `is_active` boolean only — there is no richer status enum in the
schema. Manual accounts have no `oauth_tokens` row and cannot publish. Cross-user
administration (viewing another user's accounts) is out of scope here and belongs to the
`account-admin` module.
